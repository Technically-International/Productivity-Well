## Overview
### Description
This Project is an app that is based around helping the user build good habits. While also giving people all around the world an opportunity to have access to clean drinking water.

This app lets the user set a certain amount of time in which they wish to work on a specific task without any distractions. While the timer is running, the user's calls and texts will be deferred by the app. Also, while the timer is running, the user will not be allowed to use certain apps. If the user opens any apps that are designated distractions, the user will have to give up a pre-designated amount of money. Before the user starts the timer for their task, the user will have to set aside a certain amount of money that they are willing to give up if they do not complete the task. All the money collected from the user will be donated to a nonprofit orginization based around providing clean water people who do not have access to it.

This app also allows users to connect with other users and show off how productive they have been.
